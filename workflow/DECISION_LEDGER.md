# MetaFindV1 Decision Ledger

> **Material decisions only.**
>
> This is not a research log, not a conversation log, and not a finding dump. Findings live in decision files, HANDOFFs, and audit documents. Only decisions that change project state are recorded here.
>
> Master maintains this file. D0 and D-tasks do **not** write their own recommendations here as FINAL.
>
> Governing rules: `workflow/WORKFLOW.md` §13A (Finding vs Decision), §13B (User Review Gate), §13C (USER REVIEW BRIEF).

---

## The rule

> A material decision reaches `USER_APPROVED` **only** when the user approves it.
>
> Claude + Codex + Master consensus does **not** substitute for user approval.

Master's `ACCEPT` / `ACCEPT WITH FOLLOW-UP` enters this ledger as `AWAITING_USER_REVIEW`, never as `USER_APPROVED`.

---

## Status vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `PROPOSED` | A decision has been formulated but no Master integration review has completed |
| `AWAITING_USER_REVIEW` | Master has reviewed and recommended. A USER REVIEW BRIEF is owed or delivered. **Not yet project state** |
| `USER_APPROVED` | The user approved. **FINAL ACCEPTED.** Master may integrate into MASTER.md, CONTEXT.md, INDEX.md, dependency state, and project-wide contracts |
| `USER_REJECTED` | The user rejected. The underlying finding may still stand; the proposed remedy does not |
| `SUPERSEDED` | Replaced by a later decision. **Never delete a superseded entry** — mark it and point to the replacement |

`MODIFY` is recorded as `USER_APPROVED` with the **user's** wording as the decision, and Master's original proposal retained in the notes.

`INVESTIGATE MORE` leaves the entry at `AWAITING_USER_REVIEW` with the additional investigation named.

---

## What belongs here

Any addition, modification, confirmation, or reversal of:

paper interpretation · architecture · implementation choice · deviation · dataset semantics · annotation semantics · preprocessing · training protocol · evaluation protocol · shared artifact semantics · cache validity · checkpoint validity · dependency ordering · scientifically meaningful assumption · anything that can materially change reproduction results

**When in doubt, record it.**

## What does not belong here

Routine execution that changes no scientific behaviour and no shared contract: local refactors inside an approved scope, test scaffolding, log formatting, documentation corrections that only make a comment describe existing code accurately.

---

## Entry format

Each entry records:

```
### <Decision ID>

| | |
|---|---|
| Source | task / D0 that produced it |
| Issue / Finding | what was discovered (a FINDING, not a remedy) |
| Evidence references | file:line, paper section, measurement, decision file section |
| Decision / Resolution | what is to be done (a DECISION) |
| Authority classification | PAPER FACT / UPSTREAM FACT / OBSERVED IMPLEMENTATION / OBSERVED DATA / INFERENCE / IMPLEMENTATION CHOICE / DEVIATION / USER DECISION |
| USER final decision | APPROVE / REJECT / MODIFY / INVESTIGATE MORE / — |
| Affected components | tasks, artifacts, stages |
| Status | see vocabulary above |
| Date | proposed / resolved |
```

Keep the Issue and the Decision in separate rows. Do not merge them.

### `DL-003` — Stage 1 protocol refresh, τ = 0.5, and legacy-corpus rerun protection

| | |
|---|---|
| **Source** | `D2a_stage1-protocol-refresh` |
| **Issue / Finding** | `load_protocol()` refused the on-disk protocol after D10's B-2. τ = 0.5 had no code path (`resolve_stage1.py` hardcoded 0.07, 0 CLI flags). And `annotate_run.is_complete()` keyed on a contract **no** record carried, so a bare invocation would have queued **45,955** records — overwriting a corpus the user decided to preserve, and resolving `D0-003` by mutation |
| **Evidence references** | Master re-ran, read-only: `build_work_list(force=False)` → todo **0**; `force=True` → **45,955**; state histogram `{accepted_legacy_v3: 45952, legacy_v1_residual_unresolved: 3}`; `load_protocol()` → `metafind_v2_cm@8e4b1fcc66c7f48c`; artifacts `0.5` / `False`; `prompt_version {3: 45952, 1: 3}`; 547 passed · 2275 checks · PRE-FLIGHT PASSED |
| **Decision / Resolution** | Accept the task. τ = 0.5 with `learnable_temperature: false` written through n05b; protocol refreshed to the ratified serializer; AC-1 satisfied via a **declared registry** (`data/outputs/annotation_provenance.json`) plus a relocated work-list predicate; the 45,952 formalized as accepted legacy-v3 under `VALIDATOR_VERSION 2`; the 3 residuals explicitly `legacy_v1_residual_unresolved` |
| **Authority classification** | τ = 0.5 = **PAPER FACT** (`3experiments.tex:15`) · `learnable_temperature: false` = **USER-RATIFIED IMPLEMENTATION CHOICE** on a strongly-supported inference — the paper uses "learnable" for `f_h`/`f_x`/λ but calls τ a "temperature hyperparameter" twice, and never states τ is non-learnable · AC-1 mechanism = IMPLEMENTATION CHOICE within the approved menu · registry choice, legacy-v3 formalization = **USER DECISION** |
| **Scope deviation — ratified** | **MIF-2.** `n05b` writes **three** artifacts (`resolve_stage1.py:660-662`); the contract declared two. `variant_registry.json` was rewritten. Master proved the rewrite byte-identical (`VARIANTS` absent from the diff; `_write()` is a deterministic `json.dump(indent=1)`). Root cause: **Master's contract under-declared the write surface**, not executor conduct. **USER RATIFIED 2026-08-21.** The contract was **not** retroactively edited |
| **USER final decision** | **`APPROVE`** — task accepted, MIF-2 ratified |
| **Affected components** | `resolve_stage1.py` · `annotate_run.py` · `annotate.py` · tests · `stage1_hyperparameters.json` · `stage1_encoding_protocol.json` · `variant_registry.json` · new `annotation_provenance.json` · new `tools/declare_annotation_provenance.py` · `docs/graph/README.md:270` |
| **Status** | **`USER_APPROVED`** — FINAL ACCEPTED |
| **Date** | reviewed 2026-08-21 · approved 2026-08-21 |

**Codex findings retained, not deleted because fixed** (user instruction): a JSON-`null` sidecar could be re-queued; unchanged `prompt_version` with changed content could leave provenance stale. Both fixed with regression tests. Full record in `CODEX_REVIEW.md`.

**Explicitly NOT resolved:** `D0-003`. The 3 legacy-v1 residuals remain unresolved and are labelled as such in the registry. Nothing claims otherwise.

**Does NOT unblock `D1`.** Chain: `D2a USER_APPROVED → D10 final USER REVIEW with AC-1 evidence → D10 USER_APPROVED → D1_n06-reencode`.

**Open follow-ups:** F-2 `sidecar_path()` uid validation (pre-existing, LOW, unassigned) · F-3 Master under-declared `tools/` scope for the registry tool, same class as MIF-2 · F-4 TASK §12.1's AC-1.a snippet is stale, now marked SUPERSEDED · F-5 Master holds no pre-task corpus fingerprint.

### `DL-002` — Stage 1 encoding contract implementation

| | |
|---|---|
| **Source** | `D10_stage1-encoding-contract` |
| **Issue / Finding** | The cache-validity blocker (a resumed n06 would build a two-distribution gallery), the unimplemented ratified template, and four open annotation-pipeline gaps. Plus **FIND-8**, discovered at Master review: `annotate_run.is_complete()` keys on `annotation_contract`, which **no** existing record carries, so a bare invocation would queue **45,955** records for re-annotation |
| **Evidence references** | `encode_text_image.py:73-83`, `:86-108` · `annotate_run.py:98`, `:250` · `resolve_stage1.py:243` · `tools/preflight_stage1_text.py` (run by Master) · `CODEX_REVIEW.md` (2 rounds, 12 findings) · `HANDOFF.md` |
| **Decision / Resolution** | Ratify the implementation in principle: serializer, `text_serialization_id` / cache validity, `load_protocol` mismatch rejection, Stage 1 text pre-flight, >77 true-token hard gate, P-1…P-5, annotation contract versioning, and 3 user-authorised manual translations. **Acceptance withheld** pending `AC-1` |
| **Authority classification** | B-1/B-3 mechanisms = IMPLEMENTATION CHOICE · late template binding = **bug fix** · P-1…P-5 = IMPLEMENTATION CHOICE, **USER DECISION** to ratify the scope extension · 3 translations = **DEVIATION**, user-authorised · legacy-v3 retention = **USER DECISION** |
| **Acceptance condition** | **`AC-1`** — absent explicit force or migration intent, the accepted legacy-v3 corpus must not be automatically treated by `annotate_run` as requiring re-annotation. Sub-conditions AC-1.a…AC-1.e in the brief §7.0. Assigned to `D2a` |
| **USER final decision** | `MODIFY` 2026-08-21 (acceptance withheld pending `AC-1`) → **`APPROVE` 2026-08-21** after `D2a` (`DL-003`) demonstrated `AC-1` |
| **Affected components** | `resolve_stage1.py` · `encode_text_image.py` · `annotate.py` · `annotate_run.py` · `tools/preflight_stage1_text.py` · 3 annotation records (backed up) · `D1`, `D2a`, `D3`, `D4`, `D7` |
| **Status** | **`USER_APPROVED`** — FINAL ACCEPTED |
| **Date** | reviewed 2026-08-21 · MODIFY 2026-08-21 · **APPROVED 2026-08-21** |

**`AC-1` — CLEARED.** All five sub-conditions verified by Master through the **production** work-list path `build_work_list()` (`annotate_run.py:439`), not through the superseded `is_complete()` predicate: bare todo TOTAL **0** · legacy-v3 queued **0** · residuals queued **0** · `--force` **45,955** · histogram `{accepted_legacy_v3: 45952, legacy_v1_residual_unresolved: 3}` · no fake v4 `annotation_contract`.

**`G-7` is NOT ratified by this acceptance — it remains independently OPEN.** The user declined to rule on it in this decision, and D10's FINAL ACCEPTED status must **not** be read as approving it:

| | Item | Impact today |
|---|---|---|
| G-7 §5 | Four in-code comment corrections outside R-1/R-2/R-3 | zero behavioural |
| G-7 §6 | Whether the `math.isfinite()` guard belongs in `serialize_annotation()` rather than only in the pre-flight | 0 records |

**Other items explicitly not blocking, carried forward:** `D0-003` **UNRESOLVED** · MIF-D10-3 routed to `D3`/`D4` (re-verified 2026-08-21: `stage1.py:110` and `gallery_index.py:215` load NPZ directly; neither file mentions `text_serialization`) · **F-2** `sidecar_path()` uid validation, LOCAL, pre-existing · template retrieval impact **UNKNOWN**.

**Unblocks:** `D1_n06-reencode`.

**Briefs:** `USER_REVIEW.md` (Rev 2), `USER_REVIEW_FINAL.md`

### `DL-001` — Stage 1 text serialization design (U-15)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Source** | `D0-008_stage1-text-template` |
| **Issue / Finding** | The paper specifies no text serialization format (PAPER FACT as to silence). The recorded protocol artifact describes a different template from the one the encoder runs. The running serializer rendered 161 real dimensions as `0 centimetres`, emitted 3,643 ungrammatical articles, and knowingly encoded 1 over-length record. Four in-code justifications did not describe the code |
| **Evidence references** | `2methdology.tex:28` and caption `:24` · Figure 2 (`data-preprocess.png`) · `resolve_stage1.py:96-100`, `:102-115`, `:116-128`, `:162` · `encode_text_image.py:73-83`, `:86-108`, `:194`, `:233` · full-corpus scan of 45,952 v3 records · decision file §6, §9, §10, §11 |
| **Decision / Resolution** | Ratify the design in §11.3: template form, field set and order, centimetres, `width → length → height`, E-1 (dimension precision), E-2 (article removal), E-3 (re-annotate the CJK record), S-1 (uniform formatter, no threshold), S-2 (category capitalisation), R-3 (**delete** the unreachable placement entry), and omission of `synset` / `volume` / `mass` |
| **Authority classification** | Field **set** = PAPER FACT · centimetres = INFERENCE as to intent, OBSERVED DATA as to this corpus · `width,length,height` = INFERENCE from Figure 2 · everything else = **IMPLEMENTATION CHOICE** · E-1/E-2/E-3/S-1/S-2 = **USER DECISION** |
| **Binding user modification** | Omission of `synset` / `volume` / `mass` is an **IMPLEMENTATION CHOICE** with **UNKNOWN retrieval impact**. Must **not** be stated as a PAPER FACT or described as proven redundant. The redundancy argument is WITHDRAWN (Codex C-6) |
| **USER final decision** | `MODIFY` → **`APPROVE`** |
| **Affected components** | `resolve_stage1.py` · `stage1_encoding_protocol.json` · every Stage 1 text embedding · `D10`, `D1`, `D2`, `D3`, `D4`, `D7` · every text-conditioned column of Table 1 |
| **Status** | **`USER_APPROVED`** — FINAL ACCEPTED |
| **Date** | proposed 2026-08-21 · approved 2026-08-21 |

**Explicitly outside this decision:** the n06 cache completion/validity gate (decision file §11.2, B-1…B-4). It is an execution question owned by `D10_stage1-encoding-contract`. This approval neither clears nor waives it.

**Outstanding follow-ups:** FU-2…FU-5 (`D10`) · FU-6 (Master, done at approval) · FU-7 (Master → `D0-003`) · FU-8, FU-9 (deferred). FU-1 is not carried by this decision.

**Integrated at approval:** `workflow/CONTEXT.md` §5 (FU-6), `workflow/MASTER.md`, `workflow/INDEX.md`, this ledger.

**Not yet implemented:** the ratified template does not yet exist in `resolve_stage1.py`. That is FU-2, owned by `D10`.

---

## Migration backlog

**Migration backlog is now empty.** Both pre-gate items — `D0-008` and `D10` — have passed through the gate and reached `USER_APPROVED`.

`workflow/WORKFLOW.md` §19 governs work completed **before** the user review gate was adopted.

Such work is **not** re-run: evidence surveys, Codex reviews, Claude verification of Codex findings, tests, and implementations all stand as produced. What is owed is the tail of the flow:

```
existing completed artifacts
→ Master integration review
→ USER REVIEW BRIEF
→ USER final decision
```

Any acceptance Master recorded before the gate existed is **reclassified as a MASTER RECOMMENDATION** and carries status `AWAITING_USER_REVIEW` here.

| Decision / Task | Pre-gate state | Ledger status | What is owed |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~~`D0-008_stage1-text-template`~~ | Master recorded `ACCEPT WITH FOLLOW-UP` pre-gate | **CLEARED 2026-08-21** → `DL-001`, `USER_APPROVED` | Migration complete. Brief delivered, user returned MODIFY then APPROVE |
| ~~`D10_stage1-encoding-contract`~~ | Executed against D0-008's pre-gate acceptance | **CLEARED 2026-08-21** → `DL-002`, `USER_APPROVED` | Migration complete. `AC-1` satisfied by `D2a`; implementation and Codex review were **not** re-run |

Master must not treat a pre-gate acceptance as though the gate had been satisfied.

---

## Maintenance rules

1. Only Master edits this file.
2. A D0 decision file's status and this ledger must agree. If they disagree, the ledger is the project-level record and the decision file is corrected.
3. `USER_APPROVED` is written only after the user's actual approval, with its date.
4. Superseded entries are **marked**, never deleted, and must name their replacement.
5. When a decision is approved, Master integrates it and records which files were updated.
6. If a decision is later found to rest on a mistaken finding, add a new entry that supersedes it. Do not edit the original's conclusion.
